<h2 style = "text-align: center;">  Chapter Two </h2>

<p>
In the Spring of 2018, I was invited to speak about my work at a number of events. These events were all around the world. Some of these events included the 'Al Congress Vegas’ which is held in Las Vegas, ‘The Cube Tech Fair’ which takes place in Berlin and many more. However, while I was in Shanghai, China for another event, I was kidnapped by members of the Russian secret forces. They had taken me in a car and blindfolded me and drove only what seemed to be a half an hour distance from the event. They sat me in a chair in an abandoned building and demanded I tell them anything I knew about the Chinese systems as they had found out that I was working with them and figured I was an easy target to gather any information. They tied me to a chair until I answered any questions but I told them everything I knew but they just didn’t believe that’s all I knew. I only had to hope that some people had noticed I was missing from the event back in China as I knew I would be stuck here for long and hopefully they would all start looking for me soon.
