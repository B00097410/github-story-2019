<h2 style = "text-align: center;">  Chapter Three </h2>

<p>
It had been a few hours and the Russians had started to get really angry as I wasn’t giving any information. There were four men around me and only one of them spoke English so when they were speaking Russian, I was getting worried as I didn’t know what they were saying or what they were going to do to me. About a half an our later, a glimpse of a small light caught my eye in this large dark building. I then heard the voice of a man shouting down the door and then before I knew it, there were lights everywhere and people shouting. The Russian men had fled and I was finally found. All of a sudden people were running up to me and making sure I was ok. The fear was real and I was just so happy I was found when I was. The police had chased the men that had taken me and luckily had caught them all. After a few days I had taken a plane back to Ireland and returned to tell the tail of the life of a computer scientist in the Spring of 2018. Who knew computer science could be so mad.
