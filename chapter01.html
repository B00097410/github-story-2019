<h1> Spring Morning </h1>

<h2 style = "text-align: center;">  Chapter One </h2>

<p>
Spring in Ireland takes place in the months of March, April and May. The weather in Spring starts to improve and flowers start to blossom. The change in weather can also be a change in a lot of people’s daily lives including mine. I feel as though I have more time to enjoy my bright evenings and to get more done. This is a tale of how one plucky young girl learned to harness these grand oul stretch in the evenings and become the greatest computer programmer in all of D15. I first began to notice I had super powers with regards to computer programming at age nine when my teachers used the word “Prodigy” to describe my innate intuition. My first computer was an Atari 79 which I quickly learned to code on. By age seventeen I was being pulled in multiple directions by tech giants apple and Microsoft and was even approached by the Chinese secret police to develop a software capable of recognising faces that would later be used in the internment camps currently being operated in the Xinjiang province. Alas everything was about to change for the young girl they called “the next Bill Jobs”.
